            Three little pigs build houses out of straw, sticks, and bricks. The pigs that have a house of sticks and straw make fun of their brother for taking so long to build his house. A wolf comes by and destroys the 2 houses of sticks and straw. They flea to
            the third house of bricks where the wolf cant blow down the house and typically dies by being outsmarted. The other two pigs acknowledge their brother was smart to make his house out of bricks.
